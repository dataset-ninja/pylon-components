The **Pylon Components** dataset serves as a valuable resource for the pylon components inspection community, offering accessibility to a diverse collection of data. It comprises 555 images, provided in both jpg and png formats, showcasing three distinct categories of pylon components: *insolator*, *covered_insolator*, and *pylon*. Moreover, the dataset is accompanied by annotation files containing bounding boxes for each image.

In the context of machine learning and computer vision, this dataset presents a compelling three-class classification challenge. The images encompass a wide range of dimensions, reflecting the inherent variability in the field. Furthermore, they have been captured from various angles using a drone camera, further adding to the dataset's richness and practicality for real-world applications.
