**Pylon Components: An open-source pylon components and fault detection dataset for training the ML Algorithms** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 522 images with 1077 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *insolator*, *covered_insolator*, and *pylon*.

Images in the Pylon Components dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (522 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the [SDU UAS Center, Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/sduuascenter).

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 3 classes:
