**Pylon Components: An Open-source Pylon Components and Fault Detection Dataset for Training the ML Algorithms** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the energy industry, and in the drone inspection domain. 

The dataset consists of 522 images with 1077 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *insolator*, *covered_insolator*, and *pylon*.

Images in the Pylon Components dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">SDU UAS Center, Denmark</span>.
